The first troupe, all amateurs, began using the Highlands School auditorium in the mid-1930s.  “Even to this day,” writes historian Randolph Shaffner, “the acoustics are nearly perfect.” They formally organized in the late 1930s as the Highlands Little Theatre, which was ultimately renamed Highlands Playhouse. The first big production was the Broadway comedy “Dulcy.” Reserved seats cost 50¢. Bleacher seats were 35¢.  And it was a sell out crowd. Over the years, the local ensemble began to bring in professionals and mounted sophisticated plays by important authors: Molière, Ionesco, George Bernard Shaw, and Thornton Wilder. Highlands Playhouse has its share of distinguished alumni. Collin Wilcox, a regular on the local stage, went on to play opposite Gregory Peck in the film “To Kill A Mockingbird,” as Mayella.\n\nToday, Playhouse Theatre, with 3-4 plays each summer, is still a springboard for local drama students to hone their skills alongside professional mentors.  For children, the Playhouse Theater Summer Camp offers fun, hands-on exposure to the magical experience of writing and performing a play. And off-season, the performance space becomes a movie theatre for first-run films. Highlands Playhouse will soon have a new home − joining other cultural organizations in the newly expanded Performing Arts Center.

Narrowing our focus to these four areas allows churches to use their resources effectively as they live out God’s vision for the church.\n\nEngaging in Ministry with the Poor\nChrist calls us to be in ministry with the poor and marginalized. Our emphasis is on “with” – standing with those who are regarded as “the least of these,” listening to them, understanding their needs and aspirations, and working with them to achieve their goals. It also means addressing the causes of poverty and responding in ways that lift up individuals and communities. United Methodists believe working side by side with those striving to improve their situation is more effective long term than top-down charity.\n\nImproving Global Health\nKnowing that poverty and health are intertwined, The United Methodist Church has been a key player in fighting diseases such as malaria and AIDS and promoting initiatives that improve well-being. The church had a $75 million goal to provide education, infrastructure, communication and prevention measures to defeat malaria. In fact, the death rate from malaria in Africa has been cut in half, thanks to international efforts such as the denomination’s Imagine No Malaria campaign.  A new “Abundant Health” campaign for the denomination would reach one million children with lifesaving interventions by 2020.\n\nDeveloping Principled Christian Leaders\nThe church needs leaders rooted in Christ, who have a vision for changing the world. Today’s young people have fearless hearts, vibrant ideas and a passion for ministry. Their talents should be nurtured to shape the church’s path into the future. The church must recruit young people — including women and people of color the world over — for ministry, equip them to be effective leaders and be open to where they want to lead us. We also must strengthen lay members, who are ministering at every level of the church.\n\nCreating New and Renewed Congregations\nAround the world, United Methodists are innovating with what it means to be the church, planting new congregations and revitalizing faith communities in every kind of setting. United Methodists seek to re-evangelize the world so that we can reach more people, especially the young and those from diverse backgrounds. By being relevant and vital, United Methodists will touch more lives and draw more people to Christ.','','https://wesleymemumc.com/','Wesley Memorial United Methodist Church-Fort Myers','',NULL),(2104,590968911,'LARC, Inc','2570 Hanson Street','','Fort Myers','FL','33901','USA','239-334-6285','LARC\'s mission is to empower and support individuals with disabilities and their families to achieve their full potential.','','https://larcleecounty.org','LARC, Inc.','',1954),(2105,590973728,'St. Hilary\'s Episcopal Church','5011 McGregor Boulevard','','Fort Myers','FL','33901','USA','239-936-1000','Mission & Meaning\nWe are the faith community you have been looking for - where progressive Christianity meets the tradition of common prayer, social justice and outreach.\n\nSt. Hilary\'s Episcopal Church is committed to befriending followers and non-followers of God, acting in a compassionate manner and being subject to one another.
